# Audio-Genre-Classification
Code for my CS82 final project where I did audio genre classification
This repo doesn't contain the data.json or dataset inside, Those can be generated by running the preprocessing and feature extraction notebooks
I used the FMA dataset publically available on github. Great Dataset, would recommend.<br>
I lot of this code is based off of Valerio Velardo's Deep Learning (for Audio) with Python youtube series. It is a very good playlist for anyone trying to get into machine learning https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-wATfeyAMNrtbkCNsLcpoAyBBRJZVlnf

Hope you enjoy!
